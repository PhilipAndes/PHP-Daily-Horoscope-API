# horoscope

Started coding: dec, 2018.

Week 6 bootcamp at CodeGorilla.

This week we learned about API's and how we can use them. 

I decided to make a website about horoscopes that retrieve all information from a API. 

I also had to include a database for the images. 

Also fully responsive! 

Was a fun project to make and again really learningfull.
